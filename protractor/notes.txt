This tutorial will set up a test using a local standalone Selenium Server to control browsers. You will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to run the standalone Selenium Server. 
Check this by running java -version from the command line.

---->>>npm install -g protractor
This will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager. Try running protractor --version to make sure it's working.

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running. 
Use it to download the necessary binaries with:

---->>>webdriver-manager update

Now start up a server with:

---->>>webdriver-manager start

This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser. Leave this server running throughout the tutorial. 
You can see information about the status of the server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
Leave this server running 

In a new cmd prompt
--->>> protractor conf.js

You should see a Chrome browser window open up and navigate to the Calculator, then close itself (this should be very fast!)
